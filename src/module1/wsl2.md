During installation of Docker Desktop Application. Docker Desktop will install Ubuntu linux distro also

## check ip address of Linux ubuntu
```
> wsl hostname -I
172.20.255.117
```
- We will use this ip to connect service inside docker

**List Linux in wsl:**
- use command ```wsl --list``` to show Linux WSL distribution. Output will show below

![](../assets/images/docker_desktop_web10.png)

- we see linux name **docker-desktop** which install belong to Docker-Desktop which have docker process run inside

- if we want to Change default WSL Distro, we can use command ```wsl --set-default```  `<name linux wsl>`. Example below


```
> wsl --set-default Ubuntu-24.04
```

## Understand WSL command to connect linux
- connect to Linux WSL distro use command ```wsl -d ```  `<name linux wsl>`. if we use command with out name it will connect to Default linux.
After connect already we will go linux shell (Bash) inside linux 

```
wsl 
wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04
```

- Congratuation. We inside linux already.
- use exit command to exit from linux


Test 2 Docker Command: to verify
- Open Windows Terminal and use docker command from windows (Remember)
```

Benefits of WSL 2
To recap:

1. Virtual machines are resource intensive and create a very disconnected experience.
2. The original WSL was very connected, but had fairly poor performance compared to a VM.
3. WSL 2 brings a hybrid approach with a lightweight VM, a completely connected experience, and high performance.


Add in the WSL extension in Visual Studio Code and you have the best of all worlds â€“ Linux and Windows compatibility for your tools with excellent performance and a seamless development experience

Connect to WSL 
- Connect to WSL  (default WSL distribution)
- Connect to WSL using Distro (Select WSL distribution)

![](../assets/images/vscode_container2.png)

Try to select WSL using Distro. VS code will list of WSL distribution

![](../assets/images/vscode_container3.png)

![](../assets/images/vscode_container4.png)
1. show connected WSL distribution
2. Click file explorer
3. Open Folder inside Linux WSL Distro

## Connect to Linux WSL Distroy
- open Terminal in normal user 
```
wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04
```
![](../assets/images/vscode_container7.png)

- We will get Linux terminal 

## Open VScode Editor directly in Linux WSL
